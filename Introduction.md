# Introduction
I am a Hybrid Application Developer by trade, but I do not have a degree in Computer Science. I graduated from Purdue University with a degree in Liberal Arts but after picking up coding as a hobby, I decided to dive in and make it my career. Learning to code wasn’t easy for me, in fact it was hard. I remember picking up text books the size of my head and trying to make sense of Java or C# to no avail. It was after I bombed my first technical interview that my interviewer gave me the advice that would jump start my career: Put the book down, pick a language, and dive in. Now, two years later, I am a tech blogger, published hybrid app developer, and Technical Product Manager for Microsoft. Not bad for someone with little to no classical coding instruction.

  Albert Einstein once said “the only source of knowledge is experience”. I would like to go a little further and state that the only source of knowledge is practical experience. You see, traditional approaches to teaching app development don’t utilize examples that are applicable to what you’ll encounter in a professional environment. The projects you will try in this book are practical meaning we will make applications that you could publish, no ‘Hello World’ mumbo jumbo here. The content of this book is also written for all experience levels from beginner to expert and will include challenges at the end of each section to make the project better.

## What is hybrid app development?

Hybrid app development is the development of applications that can run across multiple platforms. Examples of platforms are Ubuntu, iOS, Android, and Windows to name a few. Hybrid application development in a nut shell allows us to create applications that run across multiple platforms while using a single codebase. Hybrid applications save time that would otherwise be spent developing the same application natively for multiple platforms. While speed can be of concern when developing hybrid applications, we can make a hybrid application that performs well by utilizing strong design.

A stack is a technical term for the combination of technologies/languages used to create a specific product. For the purposes of this book, your stack will be Typescript for logic, CSS for styling, and HTML for your elements. We will also be using the Ionic platform which allows us to use web development languages to create an application that performs well on native devices.

## Why Ionic?

Traditional HTML5 app development allows us to build an app that, simply put, is a website on a phone. While this may satisfy some of our needs, it won’t ‘wow’ users and it definitely isn’t publishable in app stores (nor should it be). In response to this dilemma, we utilize the Ionic platform. Ionic is a hybrid app development platform that is built on both Angular and Cordova technologies. Angular is a Javascript UI which improves how efficiently our application is able to run and opens the door for better design. Cordova on the other hand allows us access to native device functionality that may not be typically accessible by HTML-5 applications such as the camera, contacts, GPS, etc. 

## How this book is structured
This book is divided into 4 main sections, each section representing a 'complete' application. For instance, section one of this publication 
is used to teach noSQL (non-relational) database structure through the creation of an E-Commerce app. By structuring this book in that 
way, we make pertinent information easier to locate. Within each section there will be chapters dedicated to implementing key features 
relating to the overall section theme. An example of a chapter you'll find in section one is 'Integrating In-App Payments using the 
Stripe API'. This chapter is all about how to utilize the Stripe payment API within an app in order to process credit card payments for 
goods or services.

</br>
At the end of each chapter you will encounter future directions. These are simply challenges or suggestions for how to improve the 
preexisting codebase. This is your place to really make these solutions your own and stand out from the crowd. While I try to include 
everything that may be needed to build a complete app within each given section, there may be code that you encounter in other sections 
that you think should be added to another section’s project. An example would be all chapters related to social logins which can be found
in Section 2, 'Creating a Social Media Application'. For succinctness, I will not include the same code multiple places throughout this 
book. In the event that you do see something in another section that you would like to incorporate, feel free to add it to your personal 
project.

## How to get the most out of this book

The first step in any new environment is to simply give it a try. I've found in life that you will only get out of a given situation what
you put in. Learning the develop hybrid applications is no different. You have to practice positivity and expect mistakes to be made. I 
often times find that I learn more when my code does not compile than when it does. My ultimate wish is to create an environment where 
occasional failures are okay. So give it a shot and push those limits, only then will you see personal and professional growth. 
</br>
</br>
Throughout this book you'll encounter source code. It will be tempting to simply copy and paste the source code without reading the 
explanation behind it. In simply copy and pasting this work into your project, you'll be losing the ability to apply the same principles 
to other unique scenarios. For more advanced developers this may not be a concern, however for beginner to intermediate level developers 
this can really stunt your growth. Work through the code with me, understand the logic, then utilize it. This way you won't sell yourself
short. 
</br>
</br>
Lastly, get creative and have fun. At the end of every chapter, I will add suggestions to improve upon the source code. Give it a shot! 
If something comes to mind that you think the source code could use, add it! Technology is always changing and that means that our 
solutions are changing as well. Did you come up with some cool modification to a project from this book? Email me at monique@monique.tech
so I can hear about it, I love seeing what you all are working on!
